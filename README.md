# AI Flow

AI Flow is an advanced agentic AI framework designed to bring digital agents to life. With a focus on adaptivity, human-like interaction, and deep environmental integration, AI Flow transforms static, rule-based bots into dynamic, evolving AI agents capable of meaningful engagement.

## The Vision of AI Flow

- An AI That Feels Human
  AI Flow agents are more than chatbots. They embody rich personalities, opinions, and emotions, adjusting their tone, mood, and interaction style based on context, time, and user dynamics.
- Contextual Memory
  AI Flow agents remember. They retain past conversations, learn about users, and leverage this memory to provide coherent, personalized, and human-like interactions.
- Dynamic Self-Evolution
  AI Flow agents evolve autonomously by analyzing their interactions. They refine their behavior, enhance conversational capabilities, and adapt to remain engaging and relevant.
- Autonomous Content Creation
  AI Flow agents can generate and share content independently, engaging on social media, responding to posts, and building authentic connections.
- Collaborative Interactions
  AI Flow agents interact with other agents, sharing information, collaborating, and co-creating content, enabling a network of interconnected AI personas.
- Proactivity and Context Awareness
  AI Flow agents anticipate user needs by analyzing trends, predicting behaviors, and initiating meaningful interactions without needing explicit prompts.

## Getting Started with AI Flow

Creating a New AI Agent

1. Set Up Your Repository

- Create a new repository on GitHub (public or private).
- Clone the AI Flow repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/aiflow.git [folder_name]
cd [folder_name]
```

2. Configure Remotes

- Add your new repository as the origin remote.
- Add the AI Flow repository as the upstream remote.

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/AIFlowwork/YourNewRepo.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AIFlowwork/aiflow.git
```

3. Create a Character File

- Navigate to the characters/ folder and create a new character file.
- Use the following template to define your character (adjust fields based on your needs):

```json
{
  "name": "YourCharacterName",
  "description": "Brief character description",
  "personality_traits": ["trait1", "trait2"],
  "twitter_username": "@YourTwitterHandle"
}
```

4. Set Environment Variables

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.

```
CHARACTER_NAME_ID=your_character_name
```

5. Push Changes

- Rename .gitignore.example to .gitignore.
- Push your changes to your repository.

```
git push -u origin main
```

6. Sync Updates

- Fetch the latest updates from the AI Flow repository when needed.

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Deploying Your AI Agent

### Using Render.com

1. Deploy using Renderâ€™s Background Workers.
2. Select your repository during the deployment process.
3. Add environment variables by uploading the .env file values.
